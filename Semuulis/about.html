        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Emily Jones, a passionate and creative freelance designer with over five years of experience in the industry. Based in New York City, I specialize in digital design, branding, and user experience. My journey into design began with a love for art and technology, which I later transformed into a rewarding career that allows me to help businesses and individuals bring their visions to life.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>After earning a degree in Graphic Design from the University of California, Los Angeles, I quickly dove into the world of freelancing. Over the years, I've worked with clients across various industries, including tech startups, fashion brands, and non-profit organizations. My diverse experiences have helped me develop a versatile skill set, enabling me to adapt my designs to different styles and purposes.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphic Design: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign</li>
            <li>UI/UX Design: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD</li>
            <li>Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>Branding & Visual Identity</li>
            <li>Digital Marketing: Social Media Strategy, SEO Basics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm a big believer in lifelong learning and creativity. When I'm not designing, you can find me exploring new places, practicing photography, or experimenting with new art techniques. I also enjoy reading about the latest trends in technology and design, and I’m an avid traveler with a goal to visit 30 countries before I turn 30!</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I’ve visited 18 countries so far, and Japan is next on my list!</li>
            <li>I recently completed a half marathon — never thought I'd enjoy running, but here we are!</li>
            <li>I have a black belt in Taekwondo — discipline and focus are essential parts of my life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're interested in working together or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! I'm always excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life.</p>
